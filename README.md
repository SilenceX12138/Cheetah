## Overview

This repository is inspired by the [NTU Machine Learning Course](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2021-spring.html). In that course, professor mainly focuses on the theory knowledge of machine learning and TAs will assign homework to students.

However, the explanations on homework is not quite enough for real-world application. Meanwhile, there are many practices can only be understood via coding. As a result, this repository is constructed.

This repository is not only about homework itself, but also contains many useful technical tutorials to show how these machine learning methods can be applied in daily situations.

Last but not least, there will be code update along with the lecture process.
